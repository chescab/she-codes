This project is for the SheCodes Plus workshop. We were asked to create our own Weather Application from scratch.

Designed a wireframe for my weather app.

Next, we were intructed to build our wireframe using HTML and CSS.
For the background, I have chosen this as I wanted it to have a light atmosphere. Credit from this artist.

I have chosen to opt for the moving illustration icons to create a better design. Credit to https://bas.dev/projects/weather-icons
Finally, I chose to add box shadow and transparent background to the container to have a sophisticated yet minimal look.
